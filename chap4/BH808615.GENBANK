                Possible ligation site of ends cut by 2 different
                endonucleases. Reverse complemented post-ligation sequence
                from source sequence.

LIBRARY
dbGSS lib id:   3462
CLASS:          transposon-tagged
Lib Name:       1008 - RescueMu Grid I
Organism:       Zea mays
Cultivar:       mixed background W23/A188/B73
Organ:          leaf
Tissue type:    leaf
Develop. stage: adult
Lab host:       DH10B
Vector:         RescueMu (engineered from pBlueScript backbone)
R. Site 1:      BamHI
R. Site 2:      BglII
Description:    RescueMu is a 4.9 kb, modified maize Mu transposon designed
                to allow plasmid rescue from total genomic DNA. Mu elements
                insert preferentially into transcription units. For more
                information on RescueMu, go to the web site
                www.zmdb.iastate.edu and follow the links for 'RescueMu.'
                Grid I was grown at Berkeley in 2001. DNA was extracted from
                leaf punches, double digested using BamHI and BglII, and
                ligated to form circular plasmids. DH10B cells were
                transformed and then screened on LB plates with ampicillin.
